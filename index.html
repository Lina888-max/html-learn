                starring in
                Barcelona's 5-1 win
                against
                Mallorca in LaLiga on Tuesday.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The 17-year-old returned to the starting lineup for the first time since Nov. 3 after
                recovering from an ankle
                injury as
                Barça ended a three-game winless run in the league.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">He won the penalty that led to Barça's second goal and then set up Raphinha for the
                third with
                a sublime pass
                with the
                outside of his boot, which he pointed out can be easily recreated on PlayStation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">"I think the button on FIFA is L2 [for the trivela pass]," he told Esport3 after the
                match. "It
                is something I
                can do
                quite well, something I usually do and something I will keep doing."</p>
